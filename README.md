# Website_Building_Guide_CS317_Project
Description: Project I made for my Files and Database Systems class. This app is meant to help the user pick a web hosting service they would want for their website by letting the user browse information within the app's database.

Requirements: Uses MariaDB server. Used DBeaver SQL Client, but any SQL client software will work. Python program uses tabulate library.
