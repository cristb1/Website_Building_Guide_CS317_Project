# Website_Building_Guide_CS317_Project
Description: This app is a project I made for my Files and Database Systems class. It is meant to help the user pick a web hosting service they would want for their website by letting the user browse information within the app's database. The interface is written in Python, and the database is written in SQL. This app uses a CLI interface.

Requirements: The server is a MariaDB server. I used DBeaver SQL Client, but any SQL client software will work. The Python program uses tabulate library.
